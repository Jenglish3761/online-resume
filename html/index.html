			<h2>About Me</h2>
				<p>I currently am finishing a 4 year CEAB accredited Electronics Systems Engineering (ESE) program at Conestoga College in Kitchener, ON. 
				Here I work with digital and analog electronics, embedded systems, software, signal processing, and wireless communication systems.</p>
				<p>I enjoy working with my hands and completeing projects I can be proud of</p>
				<p>In my personal time I enjoy hobby electronic projects, guitar & music, and the outdoors</p>

			<h2>My Projects</h2>
				<h3>Barbell PI</h3>
					<p>The Barbell PI project is a fitness accesory designed to track the bar path of complex exercises in order to give feedback to the user</p>
					
					<p>It uses a 9DOF inertial measurement unit to track acceleration and orientation from there it performs double integration to find relative position. 
					After this step the processed data is sent to the user's smartphone where the data can be seen graphically</p>

					<p>This is my 4th year capstone project and is still in progress...</p>
					
				<br/>
				<h3>Physio aid</h3>
					<p>The physiotherapy aid project was a look into wearable technology and prototyping using a sensor given to us by the teachers at random during my 2nd year. My team
					received a magnetic displacement sensor which takes the relative angle of a magnetic field and outputs a sine wave voltage. </p>
					<p>With this information we brainstormed a device to benifit physio patients and therapists by helping show correct range of motion in an exercise. 
					This was done by using the sensor on one side of a joint and a magnet on the other, 
					when the patient bends the joint the angle would change and we could alert the user when the have completed a full range of motion.</p>

					</video>
					
					<p>The prototype used a simple brace with with sensor and magnet attached to it. When the exercise was being performed the user would be signalled by 3 LEDS on the
					brace for when they reached certain angles of joint flexion.</p>
				<br/>	
				<h3>Elevator</h3>
					<p>The overall project plan was to build and control an elevator, leveraging the use of a CAN bus communications environment,
					coupled with networked systems to create a means of tracking the elevators operational/diagnostic data.
					The elevator cars position and status must also be viewable to computers over the Internet.</p>

					<p>The languages used for the programs were: Python, HTML, JavaScript, PHP, MySQL, CSS</p>
